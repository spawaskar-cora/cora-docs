!!! warning

    This page is work in progress.

Before settling for CoRA, it's a good idea to understand the philosophy behind the
CoRA Ecosystem, in order to make sure it aligns with your goals and project needs.
This page explains the [design principles] anchored in CoRA and explains them 
briefly in this documentation.

## Design principles

- :globe_with_meridians: __It's a Saas Web Application__: Focus on the forensic anthroplogy skills 
  you are good at and leave the software and hardware issues to us, because CoRA is managed as 
  Software as a service (Saas). No need to know Programming, Databases, HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
  – `Let CoRA do the heavy lifting for you.`

- :material-graphql: __Most Advanced Analytics__: Provides the most advanced, current and modern
  analytics and visualaizations to help you find things that matter using state-of-the-art algorithms
  including advanced statistical techniques & regression models, graph theory and AI/ML models.
   – `The algorithms in CoRA are designed to help you find things that matter`

- :material-devices: __Works on all devices__: Serve your project needs with confidence – the
  underlying layout, screens, widgets, styles and user interface automatically adapts to perfectly
  fit the available screen real estate, no matter the type or size of the viewing device.
  – `CoRA works where you are, on any device`

- :material-tape-measure: __Made to measure__: Change the colors, notifications, org, project & user 
  settings and much more with just a few clicks. CoRA can be easily customized and provides
  tons of options to alter appearance and behavior.
   – `CoRA is a delight to work with.`

- :material-clock-fast: __Fast and lightweight__: Don't let your users wait – get incredible value
  with a small footprint, by using one of the fastest specimen inventorying system around with 
  excellent performance and tracebility resulting in faster and accurate identifications.
   – `CoRA delivers on a consistent basis`

- :octicons-accessibility-inset-16: __Accessible__: Make accessibility a priority – users can navigate 
  your project data with touch devices, keyboard, and screen readers. Semantic ARIA support 
  ensures that CoRA works for everyone.
   – `CoRA is crafted for all, no one left behind`

- :material-google-circles-communities: __Open Community Driven__: Trust users across the globe – choose a 
  mature solution built with state-of-the-art Open Source technologies. Keep ownership
  of your content without fear of data lock-in.
   – `CoRA is build by people like you`
