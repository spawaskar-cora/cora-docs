This guide answers the “**why, where, and how**” questions that most users have when learning to use the CoRA platform. You’ll find lots of step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and examples. You’ll get an overview of the modules & resources that are available to you as you work on your Forensic Anthropology projects in CoRA. Finally, you’ll learn the concepts of the CoRA platform with it powerful configuration features, and establish best practices for project standards and requirements.

!!! tip

    CoRA can be used for inventorying assemblages of **single** or **commingled** human remains

Commingled human remains are often encountered in archaeological and forensic contexts. A bone by bone inventory is an important step in segregating commingled remains into individuals and determining the minimum number of individuals present. In order to achieve individual identification a controlled and consistent specimen-level inventory procedure must be followed.

The Commingled Remains Analytics (CoRA)[^1] web application, database and APIs are a powerful community resource for inventorying assemblages of single or commingled human remains, while providing a framework of analytic methods, visualization techniques and tools to assist in the segregation and identification process.

(CoRA)[^1] is a powerful web application ecosystem with an open, flexible, scalable, plug-n-play architecture and framework.

  [^1]:
    In 2016, CoRA started out as a simple specimen inventory system for Forensic 
    Anthropologists. It was first showcased at the [AAFS] 70th Annual Conference 
    in Seattle, WA in February 2018, but over the course of several years, it's now
    much more than that – with the many built-in modules such as specimens, dnas, dental,
    isotopes, missing persons, dashboards, reports, search, analytics, visualizations, 
    administration, projects, user settings, and countless customization abilities,
    CoRA is now one of the simplest and most powerful frameworks for managing a 
    single individual remains project or a complex commingled remains project.

## Installation
If you are wondering what you need to install to start using CoRA for your forensic anthropology project, the answer is **NOTHING** Yes I know its hard to believe, but its true CoRA is built and deployed as a Software as a Service (Saas) model. Why? you ask, because we believe that **you should focus on what you are good at** and leave the mundane technical software and hardware stuff to us.

### How do I get started

Dr. Pawaskar with get back to you to get the process of using CoRA for your project.

### Orgs, Projects and Users
The CoRA application is structured around the concept of organization, users and projects. What does this mean for you?
CoRA was designed to be used by both organizations and single users. Organizations can be **government organizations, non-profits, universities or any entity that deals with the identification of missing persons, or segregation of human remains**. Single users could be any single individual who wants to use CoRA for their own project, **a use case might be for university students of forensic anthropology for their Dissertation, Thesis, or Graduate Project work**.
