    This page is work in progress.

Congratulations you have found the CoRA User guide. This manual is intended to help you get the most out of your CoRA application in your day-to-day use.

This guide answers the “**why, where, and how**” questions that most users have when learning to use the CoRA platform. You’ll find lots of step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and examples. You’ll get an overview of the modules & resources that are available to you as you work on your Forensic Anthropology projects in CoRA. Finally, you’ll learn the concepts of the CoRA platform with it powerful configuration features, and establish best practices for project standards and requirements.

!!! tip

    CoRA can be used for inventorying assemblages of **single** or **commingled** human remains

Commingled human remains are often encountered in archaeological and forensic contexts. A bone by bone inventory is an important step in segregating commingled remains into individuals and determining the minimum number of individuals present. In order to achieve individual identification a controlled and consistent specimen-level inventory procedure must be followed.

The Commingled Remains Analytics (CoRA)[^1] web application, database and APIs are 
a powerful community resource for inventorying assemblages of single or commingled 
human remains, while providing a framework of analytic methods, visualization 
techniques and tools to assist in the segregation and identification process.

(CoRA)[^1] is a powerful web application ecosystem with an open, flexible, scalable, 
plug-n-play architecture and framework.

  [^1]:
    In 2016, CoRA started out as a simple specimen invertory system for Forensic 
    Anthropologists. It was first showcased at the [AAFS] 70th Annual Conference 
    in Seattle, WA in Feburary 2018, but over the course of several years, it's now
    much more than that – with the many built-in modules such as specimens, dnas, dental,
    isotopes, missing persons, dashboards, reports, search, analytics, visualizations, 
    administration, projects, user settings, and countless customization abilities,
    CoRA is now one of the simplest and most powerful frameworks for managing a 
    single indiviual remains project or a complex commingled reamins project.

## Installation

If you are wondering what you need to install to start using CoRA for your 
forensic anthropology project, the answer is **NOTHING**.
Yes I know its hard to believe, but its true CoRA is built and deployed as
a Software as a Service (Saas) model. Why? you ask, because we believe that
**you should focus on what you are good at** and leave the mundane technical 
software and hardware stuff to us.

### How do I get started

### Orgs, Projects and Users

### Reach out over email
with the following information

### Fill out an issue template
On Github

### Semantic versioning
    1.  CoRA uses [semantic versioning][^2], which is why it's a
        good idea to limit upgrades to the current major version.


  [^2]:
    Note that improvements of existing features are sometimes released as
    patch releases, like for example improved search results with additioanl
    linkable data, as they're not considered to be new features.
