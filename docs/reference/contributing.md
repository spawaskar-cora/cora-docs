# Contributing to CoRA and CoRA Docs

An introduction to contributing to the CoRA and CoRA Docs project.

The CoRA and CoRA Docs project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers 
and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of
ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the CoRA or CoRA Docs project's codebases, issue trackers, 
chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct].

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and CoRA
version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please
add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the full error and
traceback.

## Testing the Development Version

If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of
CoRA you can do so by going to [CoRA DEV]. 
This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want
to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the git master. 
It is **strongly** recommended that you do this within a [virtualenv].

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.
