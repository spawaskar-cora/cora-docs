# Methods
In this section we present an annotated bibliography of analytical methods available in CoRA. This list will be updated as new methods are developed, published and added to the CoRA environment.

## **Sex**

**Bass WM (2005).** Human Osteology: A laboratory and field manual, 5th edition.  Missouri Archaeological Society, Columbia, MO. 

* *Purpose:*  Sex determination from the skull.  
* Characteristics of the cranium and mandible at six non-metric features are described (male vs. female): supraorbital ridge (prominent vs. smooth), supraorbital margins (blunt vs. sharp), palate/dentition (large vs. small), mastoid processes (large vs. small), frontal sinuses (large vs. small), and chin shape (square vs. rounded). 

**Phenice TW (1969).** A newly developed visual method of sexing the os pubis.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 30:297-301.  

* *Purpose:*  Sex estimation based on three features of the adult os coxa: the ventral arc, subpubic concavity, and the ischiopubic ramus.
* *Sample:*  Terry Skeletal Collection, Black and White males (n = 20 and 160, respectively) and females (n = 52 and 43, respectively)
* n = 275
* Each feature is scored as: 1) female, 2) ambiguous, or 3) male.
* The ischiopubic ramus is most likely to display ambiguous morphology, and the ventral arc is least likely to display ambiguous morphology.
* If sex assessment is based on one or two of the features that are definitely male or female, the estimate will be correct at least 96% of the time.

**Rogers TL  (1999).** A visual method of determining the sex of skeletal remains using the distal humerus.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 44:57-60.

* *Purpose:*  Sex estimation based on the scoring of four dimorphic features of the distal humerus: trochlear constriction, trochlear asymmetry, olecranon fossa shape and depth, and the angle of the medial epicondyle. 
* *Sample:*  Developed on a 20th century anatomy series, the University of Toronto Grant Skeletal Collection; tested on known individuals from the University of New Mexico Documented Collection (n = 35) and the William M. Bass Donated Skeletal Collection (n = 93).
* In ambiguous cases (two traits scored as male, two traits scored as female), greater weight should be given to the olecranon fossa.  
* The greatest accuracy is achieved when all four features are present and scorable. 

**Rogers NL, Flournoy LE, McCormick WF (2000).** The rhomboid fossa of the clavicle as a sex and age estimator. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 45:61-67.

* *Purpose:*  Sex estimation based on clavicle morphology, specifically, the presence or absence of the rhomboid fossa, which is a pitted or depressed marking on the inferior sternal end of the clavicle.  
* *Sample:*  William F. McCormick skeletal collection, University of Tennessee - Knoxville, between 10 and 92 years of age.
* n = 344: 113 females, 231 males
* Males are more likely than females to have a rhomboid fossa, and rhomboid fossa are more commonly exhibited in younger individuals than older individuals. 
* This method includes posterior probabilities for the presence/absence of the fossa. 

**Walker PL (2005).** Greater sciatic notch morphology:  Sex, age, and population differences.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 127:385-391.

* Provides empirical probabilities of being male or female for a given sciatic notch score, following Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). A score of 1 typically indicates a female, while a score of 3 or greater usually indicates a male.  A score of 2 represents intermediate morphology, although a larger percentage of males than females exhibit this degree of expression. There is also a relationship between age-at-death and sciatic notch score, with younger people tending to have wider greater sciatic notches. The reference sample consists of American males and females (n = 114 and 97, respectively) who died between 1915-1955, as well as London males and females (n = 51 and 34, respectively) who died between 1761-1851.

**Walker PL (2008).** Sexing skulls using discriminant function analysis of visually assessed traits.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 136:39-50.

* Provides empirical probabilities of being male for a given score of observed cranial morphology following the ordinal scales presented in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994).  The sectioning point is 0, and scores less than 0 are more likely to be male, and scores greater than 0 are more likely to be female.  The probability distributions are based on 304 skulls of known sex from European American, African American, English (British), and 156 Native American individuals.


## **Age**
**Albert AM, Maples WR (1995).** Stages of epiphyseal union for thoracic and lumbar vertebral centra as a method of age determination for teenage and young adult skeletons.  Journal of Forensic Sciences 40:623-633.

* Age estimation by scoring fusion of thoracic and lumbar vertebral centra. Reference population consists of 55 black and white males and females between the ages of 11 and 32 years.  The correlation between stages of union and known age was 0.78 (P < .0001).

**Berg GE (2008).** Pubic bone age estimation in adult women. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 53(3):569-577.  

* Age estimation for older females, re-defining the Suchey-Brooks phases V and VI, and adding phase VII. Reference population data derived from Balkan (n = 85) and Eastern Tennessee (n = 104) samples, totaling 189 females.

**Blankenship JA, Mincer HH, Anderson KM, Woods MA, Burton EL (2007).** Third molar development in the estimation of chronologic age in American Blacks as compared with Whites. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 52(2):428-433.

* Age estimation of African American populations by scoring third molar development radiographically using the Demirjian et al. stages.  Reference population data derived 637 African Americans between the ages of 14 and 24 compared to 563 American Whites from Demirjian’s prior study. Black–White differences were significant with developmental stages occurring in blacks a year or so earlier than whites. The empirical likelihood that an African American male with fully developed M3's is at least 18 years old is 93% and that for African American female is 84%. Corresponding risks for whites are 90% and 93%. 

**Brooks S, Suchey JM (1990).** Skeletal age determination based upon the os pubis:  A comparison of the Acsádi-Nemeskéri and Suchey-Brooks methods. Human Evolution, 5:227-238.

* The Suchey-Brooks system is a 6-phase system (I-VI) for age estimation for males and females that utilizes the morphology of the entire symphyseal surface following the six phase system for males described by Katz and Suchey (1986). Reference data are derived from 1,225 individuals of known ages at death from the Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office.

**Buckberry JL, Chamberlain AT (2002).** Age estimation from the auricular surface of the ilium:  Arevised method.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 119:231-239.  

* A composite scoring method for ageestimation from the auricular surface. This method is a revision of the existing auricular surface aging method by Lovejoy et al (1985), and scores independent components of the auricular surface, rather than the gestalt. Reference data are derived from a known-age skeletal collection from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London (n = 180).

**İşcan MY, Loth SR, Wright RK (1984).** Age estimation from the rib by phase analysis: White males.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 29:1094-1104.

* Age estimation based on the morphology of the sternal end of the fourth rib (White Males). This system is a 9-phase system (0-8), requiring the sternal end of the 4th rib be compared to three-dimensional casts of known age exemplars. The reference population consists of 118 white males of known age at death.

**İşcan MY, Loth SR, Wright RK (1985).** Age estimation from the rib by phase analysis:  White females.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 30:853-863.

* Age estimation based on themorphology of the sternal end of the fourth rib (White Females). This system is a 9-phase system (0-8), requiring the sternal end of the 4th rib be compared to three-dimensional casts of known age exemplars. The reference population consists of 86 white females of known age at death.

**Kasper KA, Austin D, Kvanli AH, Rios TR, Senn DR (2009).** Reliability of third molar development for age estimation in a Texas Hispanic population: A comparison study. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 54(3):651-657.

* Age estimation of Hispanicpopulations by scoring third molar development radiographically using the method of Demirjian et al. (1973) for crown and root formation. Hispanic individuals (n = 950) aged from 12-22 years were evaluated and the third molar was found to develop 8-18 months faster than American Caucasians as reported by Mincer et al. (1993). Prediction tables for minimum and maximum age for an observed stage are provided.

**Langley-Shirley N, Jantz RL (2010).** A Bayesian approach to age estimation in modern Americans from the clavicle. Journal of Forensic Sciences 55(3):571-583.  

* Age estimation based on a 3-phase or 5-phase system for medial clavicular fusion for modern American individuals. The reference sample consists of clavicles from 1289 individuals (1044 male, 245 female): 594 individuals (448 male, 146 female) between 11 and 33 years from the William F. McCormick Clavicle Collection, 354 individuals (255 male, 99 female) between 11 and 30 years from the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection), and 341 males between 16 and 33 years from the Korean War. Due to secular trends, observed ages for each phase are provided separately for each sample. A Bayesian approach is also utilized to provide age ranges from the McCormick sample (for more modern cases).

* An 8-phase age estimation system based on auricular surface morphology. The reference population was derived from the Todd Collection (n = 500), the Libben Collection (n = 250), and forensic cases from the Cuyahoga County Coroner’s Office, Ohio (n = 14). Two completely blind tests were conducted to assess the accuracy and bias of the new method utilizing different individuals from the Todd Collection (n = 98 and 108, respectively).
  
**Mann RW, Jantz RL, Bass WM, Willey PS (1991).** Maxillary suture obliteration:  A visual method for estimating skeletal age.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 36:781-791.  

* Age estimation by assessing suture closure of the four maxillary (palatal) sutures. The reference sample consisted of 186 skeletons of known age, sex, and race from three skeletal collections: 46 White males, 32 White females, 64 Black males, and 44 Black females. Males exhibit more suture obliteration than females at the same age. Although this method cannot be used for exact estimates of individual age, it is valuable in establishing an estimated age range.  

**McKern TW, Stewart TD (1957).** Skeletal Age Changes in Young American Males.  Quartermaster Research and Development Command Technical Report EP-45, Natick, MA. 

* Age estimation by scoring epiphyseal union of various skeletal elements, as well as morphology of the pubic symphysis. The reference sample consists of American males who died as a result of the Korean War from 1950 to 1952. Because this sample is represented by military males, individuals below 17 years of age are not present, and these methods are most applicable for American males who died prior to (ca.) 1960.
  * *Epiphyseal union:* The stage of epiphyseal union is scored on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 - unfused, 1 - beginning fusion, 2 - largely fused, 3 - fused, 4 - fused with no remnant fusion line).  The stage of epiphyseal fusion can then be compared to the published standards.  McKern and Stewart present only raw data in tabular form.
  * *Pubic symphysis:* The McKern-Stewart system is a 3-component system that scores the dorsal and ventral demifaces and the rim of the pubic symphysis (each component having a 0-5 stage of development). Morphology can be compared to a cast set comprised of a representative pubic symphysis for a score of 1 to 5 for each component.  The scores for each component are combined and correspond to a given age range.        

**Meindl RS,Lovejoy CO (1985).** Ectocranial Suture Closure: a revised method for the determination of skeletal age at death based on the lateral-anterior sutures. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 68:57-66.

* Age estimation by scoring (0-open, 1-minimal closure, 2-significant closure, 3-complete obliteration) ectocranial vault and lateral anterior suture closure at ten sites. Scores are combined to produce two composite scores that correspond to estimates of age-at-death, which were found to be independent of race and sex. The reference sample consisted of 236 crania from the Hamann-Todd Collection.

**Mincer HH, Harris EF, Berryman HE (1993).** The A.B.F.O. study of third molar development and its use as an estimator of chronological age. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 38:379-390.

* Age estimation for American Whites and Blacks by scoring third molar development radiographically using the eight-grade classification system by Demirjian et al. (1973). The reference sample consists of American males (46%) and females (54%) between the ages of 14 and 24 years (n = 823). The sample consisted of white (80%), black (19%), and “other” (1%). Although the third molar is the most variable tooth, the formation of the third molar can be useful for age estimation when other elements are unavailable.

**Nawrocki SP (1998).** Regression formulae for the estimation of age from cranial suture closure. In Forensic Osteology: Advances in the Identification of Human Remains, 2nd ed., edited by Kathy Reichs, pp. 293-317. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL.

* Age estimation by scoring ectocranial, endocranial, and maxillary suture closure and provided regression formulae based on observations of American White (n = 49) and Black (n = 51) males and females (n = 50 for each). Twenty-seven cranial landmarks are scored,including 16 from the ectocranial surface, 7 from the endocranial surface, and 4 from the palate, on a scale of 0 to 3. Ten of the ectocranial landmarks are the same as Meindl and Lovejoy’s (1973) landmarks. Scores can be summed and utilized in a regression equation to predict age. Eight equations for predicting age from all cranial suture landmarks are provided. Because incomplete crania are often recovered, additional formulae using only landmarks of the calotte are also provided (Equations 9 – 15).

**Osborne DL, Simmons TL, Nawrocki SP (2004).** Reconsidering the auricular surface as an indicator of age at death.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 49:905-911.

* Age estimation based on auricular surface morphology. This method is a modified 6-phase system of the existing 8-phase auricular surface aging method by Lovejoy et al (1985). The sample for this study consisted of 266 individuals of documented age, sex, and ancestry from the Terry and Bass Donated Collections which represent early 20th century and late 20th century individuals, respectively.

**Samworth R, Gowland R (2007).** Estimation of adult skeletal age-at-death: Statistical assumptions and applications. International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 17:174-188.

* Age estimation based on features of the os coxa. This method provides 90% prediction intervals for each combination of pubic symphysis (scored following the Suchey-Brooks method, n = 376) andauricular surface (scored following the Lovejoy method, n = 448) that they observed in a combined sample of 18th-century English and 20th-century Portuguese.  These prediction intervals have been found to be accurate for 20th-century Americans as well (Passalacqua 2010).  When both scores can be observed on the same individual, a combined age estimate may be produced in this manner.  Such a combined age estimate maybe more precise than the pubic symphysis alone, particularly for individuals whose pubic symphyses are in phases 3-6. 

**Schaefer M, Black S, Scheuer L (2009).** Juvenile Osteology: A Laboratory and Field Manual. Academic Press, Burlington, MA.

* Age estimation based on epiphyseal fusion. Age ranges for developmental stages throughout the skeleton are provided. This method is meant for aging the juvenile skeleton. This manual is a compilation of aging data from numerous sources from the last hundred years from a variety of journals and texts.


## **Ancestry**

**Edgar HJH (2013).** Estimation of ancestry using dental morphological characteristics. Journal of Forensic Sciences 58:S3-S8.2013

* Ancestry estimation using nonmetric morphological dental traits to distinguish European American, African American, and Hispanic American individuals. The dental traits and scoring definitions are derived from The ASU dental series (see Turner et al. 1991). The reference population includes 509 individuals of Hispanic, African and European ancestry.

**Gill GW (1998).** Craniofacial Criteria in the Skeletal Attribution of Race. In *Forensic Osteology: Advances in the Identification of Human Remains,* 2nd ed., Reichs K (ed), pp.293-317. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL.  

* Ancestry estimation based on nonmetric craniofacial morphology. These data represent a mid-1990s collectiveassessment of observers’ experiences in the field. The variation of twenty-two traits of the skull are compared and described as typical features of American Indian, Black, East Asian, Polynesian, and White populations. The authors state that while all of the presented traits can be useful for ancestry estimation, those of the nose and mouth have shown to be the most useful. The user shouldbe cautious when applying this method as little attention is provided to the underlying distribution of traits among the populations surveyed. Method should be deprecated.

**Hefner J (2009).** Cranial nonmetric variation and estimating ancestry. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 54(5):985-995.  

* Provides underlying frequency distributions by ancestry for 11 commonly used cranial nonmetric traits. The reference sample consists of 747 individuals from four skeletal collections, comprised of prehistoric and contemporary individuals, which are separated into an African, Asian, European, and Native American. Ten of the 11 traits examined had frequency distributions with significant differences (p < 0.001) between groups, but the range in variation of these traits, particularly within groups, suggests that ancestry estimation cannot be conducted by visual observation alone.

**Hefner J, Ousley SD (2014).** Statistical classification methods for estimating ancestry using morphoscopic traits.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 59(4):883-890.    

* Ancestry estimation using six cranial nonmetric traits to separate American Whites and Blacks. OSSA is anonparametric method that compresses morphological variation into two classes.To employ OSSA, all six non-metric traits are scored using the original character states (original ordinal categories, 0-4), and then compressed to the corresponding dichotomous state (0,1). All six OSSA scores (0-6) are summed. Values of four or greater areclassified as American White; values of three or less are classified as American Black.

* Ancestry estimation based on cranial morphology (Asian, Black, White). Forty-five cranial and dental traits commonly used by Mountain, Desert, and Coastal Forensic Anthropologists were assessed for distinguishing between “American Caucasoid,” “Southwestern Mongoloid,” and “American Black:” 18 from the braincase, 13 from the face, 7 dental, and 7 from the mandible. The traits determined to be the most useful in ancestry assessment are provided for each group.


## **Other**

**Buikstra JE, Ubelaker DH (1994).** Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains.  Arkansas Archeological Survey Research Series No. 44, Fayetteville, AR.

* Data collection standardization from skeletal remains. This source consolidates multiple non-metric methods and measurements into a single source.

**Knusel CJ, Outram AK (2004).** Fragmentation: The zonation method applied to fragmented human remains from archaeological and forensic contexts.  Environmental Archaeology, 9(1):85-98.
  * Scattered and commingled human and animal remains are commonly encountered on archaeological sites, and this contextual relationship begs the question of whether human and animals were treated in a similar manner before burial. The recording system presented here provides a means by which to confront problems of equifinality – that is, when taphonomic alterations create apparently similar patterns and, therefore, confuse behavioural inferences drawn from them. This method hinges on a standardised representation of the zones on human skeletal elements that allow comparison with those described by Dobney and Rielly (1988) for animal remains. It is anticipated that the anatomical descriptions in combination with the zone drawings presented will aid others to apply the method generally across skeletal assemblages of any date. This system could also be used to aid the curation of museum collections and as a complement to forensic recovery.
