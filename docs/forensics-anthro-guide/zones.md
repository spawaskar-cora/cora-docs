In this section we present the images used in the Zonation Method for inventory of fragmented human remains, along with captions and desciptions of each of the zones. The zone method of skeletal specimen inventory is drawn from Knusel CJ, Outram AK (2004) Fragmentation: The zonation method applied to fragmented human remains from archaeological and forensic contexts.
