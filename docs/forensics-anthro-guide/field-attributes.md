**Bone** (*required field*)
* Choose element from drop-down list
* Multiple options exist for unidentifiable elements (Ex: Unidentified cervical vertebra, unidentified long bone, etc.)

**Side** (*required field*)
* Left – element is from the left side of the body
* Right – element is from the left side of the body
* Middle – element is from the middle of the body (Example: cranium, thoracic vertebra 1, etc.)
* Unsided – any element that side cannot be determined

**Completeness** (*required field*)
* Complete – a complete element is present, fragmentary or whole
   → If complete is chosen, all zones will be automatically populated.
* Incomplete – any element that is not complete

Click “save” to continue analysis. All fields can be edited/updated after the element has been saved, until “Inventoried” is checked, then changes cannot be made without approval by the project lead/manager/creator/etc.
