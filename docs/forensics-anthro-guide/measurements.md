Place one caliper point in the glabellar region in the midline and hold with fingers while the other caliper point is applied to the posterior portion of the skull in the midsagittal plane and moved up and down until the maximum length is obtained.

* *Instrument:* spreading caliper
* *Comment:*  Cra_03 is measured with the skull resting either on its base or on the occiput. The two measuring points (eurya) should lie in the same horizontal and frontal planes. Place the arms of the caliper at the same level while maintaining the hinge joint of the caliper in the mid-sagittal plane. Hold the ends of the caliper in each hand and apply to the lateral portions of the skull, making circular motions. Make sure you include areas below the squamosal suture, where the maximum is sometimes found.

If the alveolar process exhibits slight resorption or erosion at the point of (pr), the projection of the process may be estimated when the alveolar process of the lateral incisors is still intact. When resorption or erosion is more pronounced, this measurement should not be taken (Howells 1973:174; Moore-Jansen et al. 1994, #10; Langley et al. 2016:66-67, #11).

The lower border of the aperture is well defined in most populations. It is not always the most anterior edge, but the beginning of the actual floor of the nasal cavity. It is the hinder border, not the forward border, of any prenasal gutter or fossa. (Howells 1973:175; Moore-Jansen et al. 1994, #13; Langley et al. 2016:67, #14).

Measure the right orbit if the left orbit is damaged and record the side measured on the recording sheet. (Howells 1973: 175; Martin and Knussmann l988:181, #51a; Moore-Jansen et al. 1994, #15; Langley et al. 2016:68, #16).

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper
* *Comment:*  Holding the femur with the distal end up, orient the measuring arms of the caliper with the long axis of the bone to obtain this measurement (Langley et al. 2016:80-81, #85). 

**Fem_14 Minimum Anterior-Posterior Diameter of the Diaphysis:**  The minimum anterior-posterior diameter anywhere along the diaphysis. The linea aspera and condyles should be utilized in order to orient the bone in anatomical position (use the condyles to orient) (Byrd and Adams 2003, #68A). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Fem_15 Minimum Medial-Lateral Diameter of the Diaphysis:**  The minimum medial-lateral diameter anywhere along the diaphysis.  The linea aspera and condyles should be utilized in order to orient the bone (should be taken in a perpendicular orientation to 68A) (Byrd and Adams 2003, #68B). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Fem_16 Minimum Superior-Inferior Neck Diameter:**  The minimum distance from the superior surface to the inferior surface on the femoral neck (Seidemann et al. 1998). Place caliper in the saddle of the neck (superior) and close inferior caliper arm, moving as necessary to find the minimum (Byrd and Adams 2015, #68D). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Fem_17 Maximum Diameter along the Linea Aspera:**  The maximum shaft diameter at any point along the linea aspera. As the bone should be rotated to obtain the maximum distance, the measurement does not necessarily have to include the linea aspera, though it likely will (Byrd and Adams 2003, #68E). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Fem_18 Upper Breadth of Femur (VHA):**  The distance from the apex of the head of the femur to the lateral side of the femur diaphysis, measured in line with the neck of the femur such that the line of measurement bisects the neck. Using sliding calipers, place the fixed jaw on the most prominent point on the femur head. Place the movable jaw on the lateral margin of the femur diaphysis so that the line formed between the two points splits the neck into two equal portions (Simmons et al. 1990). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Fem_19 Lateral Condyle Height (LCH):**  On the lateral condyle of the distal femur, it is the distance from the most superior point on the condyle to the most inferior point. Holding the femur in anatomical position with the distal condyles facing the observer, place the fixed jaw of the sliding caliper on the top of the condyle and place the movable jaw on the most inferior point on the condyle. The femur should be held so that it is possible to accurately judge the location of the most inferior point (Simmons et al. 1990).

Place the tibia on the osteometric board resting on its posterior surface with the longitudinal axis of the bone parallel to the board (Hrdlicka 1920:129). If using an osteometric board without a hole, place the tibia on the osteometric board so that it the long axis is parallel to the board. The measurement is taken from the lateral condyle to the tip of the medial malleolus (Moore-Jansen et al. 1994, #69; Langley et al. 2016:81, #86). 

**Tib_02 Maximum Proximal Epiphyseal Breadth of the Tibia:**  The maximum distance between the two most projecting point on the margins of the medial and lateral condyles of the proximal epiphysis.

Press the lateral condyle against the vertical end board, and place the movable upright against the medial condyle. Tibiae exhibiting marked torsion may have to be rotated to obtain the maximum breadth (Martin and Knussmann 1988:221, #3; Moore-Jansen et al. 1994, #70; Langley et al. 2016:81, #87).

* *Instrument:* tape

**Tib_10 Maximum Anterior-Posterior Diameter Distal to the Popliteal Line:**  This measurement should be taken at the most distal point of the popliteal line where it intersects with the margin of the diaphysis. The calipers are rotated to find the maximum distance (this is the maximum diameter of the diaphysis at this point).  Note that the correct location may be difficult to determine in very gracile individuals (Byrd and Adams 2003, #74A). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Tib_11 Minimum Anterior-Posterior Diameter:**  Locate the minimum anterior-posterior distance at any point on the tibial shaft. Use the medial malleolus and anterior crest to orient the bone, particularly when torsion is present (Byrd and Adams 2003, #74B).

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Tib_13 Biarticular Breadth (BB):**  Maximum breadth of the proximal articular surface of the tibia as measured from the lateral edge of the lateral condyle to the medial edge of the medial condyle.  This is not the maximum breadth of the proximal tibia, but rather the maximum breadth of the articular surface.  Holding the tibia so that the proximal articular surface is in plain view, place the fixed jaw of the digital caliper on the most lateral edge of the lateral condyle.  Extend the movable jaw to what appears to be the most medial edge of the medial condyle. Pivot the movable jaw slightly to ensure that the maximum measure is found (Holland 1992). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Tib_14 Medial Condyle Articular Width (MCW):**  Maximum transverse width of the medial condyle as measured from lateral to medial edges.  The surface of the condyle generally is circumscribed by a slight rim, and points of the caliper should be placed on this rim.  Hold the tibia so that you can look directly down on the proximal articular surface.  Place the fixed jaw of the digital caliper on the medial edge of the condyle.  Extend the movable jaw to the lateral edge of the medial condyle.  Move the caliper anteriorly and then posteriorly, adjusting the jaws so that they always contact the opposing edges of the condyle. Find the maximum in this manner (Holland 1992). 

* *Instrument:* sliding caliper

**Tib_15 Medial Condyle Articular Length (MCL):**  Similar but perpendicular to width.  Measurement should record maximum length from the anterior edge of the medial condyle to the posterior margin.  Hold the tibia so that you can look directly down on the proximal articular surface.  Place the fixed jaw of the digital caliper on the anterior edge of the medial condyle. Extend the movable jaw to the posterior edge of the condyle.  Move the caliper medially and then laterally, adjusting the jaws so that they always contact the opposing edges of the condyle. Find the maximum in this manner (Holland 1992).
