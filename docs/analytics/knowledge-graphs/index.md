# Knowledge Graphs
The CoRA analytics engine provides the ability to leverage advanced analytics using project specific knowledge graphs. The CoRA knowledge graphs leverages the [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) Graph database to allow forensic anthropologists and scientists to better understand & analyze their project specimens and its related data to help in the missing persons identification process. It allows forensic scientists to find relationships between specimens using related data such as DNA, pair matching, articulations, taphonomy, anomaly, trauma, pathology, among others.

## So What is a Knowledge Graph?
A knowledge graph is a design pattern for storing, organizing, and accessing interrelated data entities, including their semantic relationships. With knowledge graphs, you can better understand your data and build more intelligent applications. A knowledge graph contains three essential elements:

1.	**Entities**, which represent the data of the organization or domain area.
2.	**Relationships**, which show how the data entities interact with or relate to each other. Relationships provide context for the data.
3.	An **organizing principle** that captures meta-information about core concepts relevant to the business.

Here is the [process guide](./cora-knowledge-graph-database-manual.pdf) that project leads and their teams can use to get access to their projects knowledge graph DBMS.


Please note that advanced analytics using knowledge graphs are worked on at a regular basis to fine tune their performance. Please consider these to be in experimentation phase until final release. You are encouraged to use the advanced analytics using knowledge graphs as is.
