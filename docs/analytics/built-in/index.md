# Built-in Analytics

The CoRA analytics engine provides some built-in analytics out of the box such as simple regression analysis for the datasets that are most commonly used in forensic anthropology. Along with these CoRA provides some visualizations that you might find very useful in narrowing down the search space
as you work on the segregation process.

Please note that built-in analytics and visualization are worked on at a regular basis to fine tune their performance. Please consider these to be 
in experimentation phase until final release. You are encouraged to use the built-in analytics as is.

    We would appreciate your use of these analytics and visualizations and your feedback on making them better and more useful to you.
    Thank you.
