## Bipartite Graph

A Bipartite Graph allows you to visualize the bipartite data effectively. Here CoRA use it to demonstrate the matching specimens and its
relationships in the form of a bipartite graph.

The following table shows the required and optional fields to generate a bipartite graph.

Attributes  | Required/Optional
------------| -------------- 
Relations   | Required
Bones       | Required
Side        | Required
Specimen    | Required
