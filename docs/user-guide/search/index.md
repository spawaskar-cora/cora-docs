# Search


CoRA provides a powerful search engine allowing you to search any modules such as Specimens, DNA, Isotopes, Dental, Missing Persons. 
Each module can be searched using multiple criteria which are related to that module. 

## Search History and Favorites
The search capability also comes with a search history and favorites, which allows the user to look at their search history and create favorites from their search history. This allows the user to quick access previous searches they may have done in a project.

### Search Options

**Max Search Limit 500**

![](media/specimen-search.png)
The server renders all results queried from the project search bar request, allowing the user to paginate and search through the entire response. Limitations with this search options, include longer response times or application overload for projects with large sets of data.

Each tab will generate a new call to the server and retrieve the next set of data. This search option is ideal for project with larger sets of data. Search result filter is not available with this option.
