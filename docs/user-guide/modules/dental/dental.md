# Dental

Dental remains are extremely important to the identification process. An individualâ€™s dental records are often the best way to identify remains as they have unique individual characteristics and may contain surviving mtDNA. If your project chooses to use Dental analysis as part of your identification process then you have come to the right place. Ideally, the project forensic odontologists will have antemortem (before death) X-rays to use for comparison, but even handwritten charts and treatment notes can be critical to the research and identification process. Here you will learn more about the Dental module in CoRA.
