# User Authentication

This section shows you how to sign in to CoRA and what to expect along the way—whether everything works smoothly or you need to take an extra step. We'll also explain the security checks that protect your access in simple terms.

## Why Authentication Matters

Authentication is the front door that keeps sensitive data safe. CoRA follows security best practices: only authorized users with the right credentials can sign in, suspicious activity (like repeated wrong passwords) is blocked, and passwords regularly expire to keep accounts secure.

## Common Login Issues and What They Mean

### Wrong Email or Password
If you enter an incorrect email address or password, you'll see this message: **"Invalid credentials. Please try again."**

**What to do:** Double-check your email and password, then try again.

### Inactive Account
If your account has been inactive for more than 60 days or was disabled by an administrator, you'll see: **"Your user account has been inactive beyond 60 days. Please contact your System Administrator."**

**What to do:** Contact your system administrator to reactivate your account.

### Password About to Expire
Passwords expire every 60 days for security. Starting 10 days before expiration, you'll see a reminder to reset your password when you log in.

**What to do:** Follow the prompts to create a new password before the 60 days are up.

### Password Has Expired
If your password has expired (after 60 days), you'll still be able to log in, but you'll be required to change it before you can do anything else in CoRA.

**Important:** Your new password cannot be the same as any of your last three passwords.

**What to do:** Create a new, unique password.

### Too Many Failed Login Attempts
If you enter the wrong credentials five times in a row, your account will be temporarily locked for security reasons.
