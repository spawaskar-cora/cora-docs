# Search Skeletal Elements

##### Skeletal Element Search
![SE Search](../images/skeletalElements/topNavBar.png)
The easiest way to search for skeletal elements is to use the top search bar in the nav bar. To complete a search, first select the project you wish to search on the left-most select field, you will only be able to view projects which are assigned to your user profile. 

![SE Project Categories](../images/skeletalElements/projectCategories.png)

By default, "Bone" is selected as the search option. Select the desired search category before typing your search text into the search bar. Then click the magnifying glass to execute your search.

![SE Search Categories](../images/skeletalElements/searchCategories.png)

Once you complete your search, you are taken to the skeletal elements search screen. The following Bone elements are displayed all the skeletal elements search screen:

- Key
- Bone
- Side
- Bone Group
- Measured
- DNA Sampled
- Isotope Sampled
- Clavicle Triage
- CT Scanned
- Xray Scanned
- Created By
- Reviewed By

![SE Search Results](../images/skeletalElements/seSearch.png)

On this page you can filter how many results are shown per page, as well as search the results.

The search function in the top right of the page searches all strings in all cells of the table. Strings are search in a substring manner - for instance the above if you search "56B", 2 rows will be returned that contain the substring "56B". 

The view the details of a skeletal elements, click on the key in the search results.
