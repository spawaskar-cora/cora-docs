# Project Dashboard

## Project Manager Dashboard
The Project Manager Dashboard serves as a high level view of both summary and aggregated project data. 
The dashboard is comprised of *widgets*, which are individual visual representations of data.  Examples of those widgets include:
  
  * Skeletal Elements Associated To Individual
  * DNA Sample Information
  * Mito sequence Information
  * Inventory Process
  
Those *widgets* can be added and removed via the *widget selector*.

The data in the dashboard is represented in 4 different formats:
 
  * Pie Chart
  * Bar Graph
  * Stacked Bar Graph
  * Line Graph

On Click of details from widgets project dashboard will be visible. It provides a detailed view of visualization and the data.
